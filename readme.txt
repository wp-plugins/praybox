Prayer request application that allows users to submit requests, or pray for existing requests

== Description ==

Prayer request application that allows users to submit requests, or pray for existing requests.  All requests can be moderated from the admin section and can be flagged by members as inappropriate requests.  There is a IP ban system in place as well to reduce inappropriate behavior.

Every time a request is prayed for, and the user clicks the "I Prayed For You" button, the requester will recieve a nightly email detailing how many prayers they received that day.
